    "Alcohol consumption is regarded as integral for a university's social culture and one's college experience. According to the National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, it has been reported that there are multiple factors that influence student drinking. Schools with strong Greek systems or prominent athletic programs tend to have students drink more than students at other schools, where alcohol consumption is highest among students living in fraternities or sororities.<a name=\"cite_ref-5\"></a>[<sup>5</sup>](#cite_note-5) College drinking can be harmful and impact multiple areas of a student's life. In our project, we study the effects of college drinking and alcohol consumption on one's academic performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "There have already been some studies done to analyze the impact of alcohol consumption on academic performance. The process of these studies have been to survey students on their alcoholic consumption and academic results, and then using different statistical methods to find an association between the two variables. However, when comparing the research with one another there have been mixed results, with the most common conclusions either being that there is a negative association between alcohol consumption and student academic performance or there not being a correlation between the two variables at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "One common conclusion is that alcohol consumption negatively affects academic performance. In a survey done by the CDC, the consensus is that students with higher grades are less likely to drink or engage in alcohol related behaviors than students with lower grades. It was reported that 12% of high school students with mostly A's had their first drink before the age of 13 (compared to 26% with mostly D's and F's), 27% reported current alcohol use (compared to 40%), and 13% reported current binge drinking (compared to 26%).<a name=\"cite_ref-4\"></a>[<sup>4</sup>](#cite_note-4) The survey proves association between alcohol consumption and academic performance, but not causation, which means that lower academic performance does not cause an increase in the likelihood that one engages in alcohol related behaviors, nor does alcohol consumption cause lower academic performance. This is valid because there can be other confounding variables that influence alcohol consumption and academic performance, such as family environment, household income, etc. Another study done by the University of Gloucester in the United Kingdom came to a similar conclusion as well. This study was measured based on multiple alcohol consumption indicators (length of time of and amount consumed during most recent drinking occasion, frequency of alcohol consumption, heavy episodic drinking, problem drinking) and multiple academic achievement indicators (importance of achieving good grades, actual academic performance, comparison of academic performance compared to peers).<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) They came to the conclusion that there are negative associations between alcohol consumption at any level and motivation for good grades and academic performance.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) \n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are other studies that found that there is no link between alcohol consumption and academic performance. One study done at the University of Hampshire measured the effect on college students' alcohol use on their GPA, in which a survey was done asking students about their average alcohol consumption per week and cumulative GPA. <a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3) It was found that most students who took the survey reported that they drank an average of 2-3 days a week, and had an average cumulative GPA of 3.0 - 3.5.<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3) The researchers came to the conclusion that there was no significant relationship between GPA and alcohol consumption. Another study done by researchers at Queen's University came to a similar conclusion, in which they measured based on the number of alcoholic drinks a student consumed each day per week, class absence, and academic performance. This study also included a confounding variable of house environment, in which they measure whether or not house environment affects alcoholic consumption. The results of the study were that there is not really a relationship between alcohol consumption and academic performance, but there was a correlation between house environment and alcohol consumption and absence rates.<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2) This means that students who lived in an environment where their roommates drank more often were more likely to drink and miss class regularly.<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2) The main limitations with each of these studies were the small sample size and a lack of understanding of students' drinking patterns. Further research, including a larger and more representative sample where research is done across multiple college campuses, will lead to a stronger conclusion. \n",

    "Main Hypothesis: \n",
    "- Higher levels of alcohol consumption are negatively correlated with students' academic performance, leading to lower final grades.\n",
    "\n",
    "This hypothesis is grounded in the assumption that alcohol consumption, especially at higher levels, can impair cognitive functions, reduce study time, and increase absenteeism, which in turn could negatively affect academic performance. The distinction between weekday and weekend consumption allows for a nuanced analysis, hypothesizing that weekday consumption, closer to academic obligations, might have a more immediate and detrimental effect on students' ability to perform academically than weekend consumption. This expectation is based on existing research that links substance use with academic difficulties, suggesting that the disruptive effects of alcohol on sleep patterns, attention, and memory processes could directly impact students' learning and assessment performances."

    "The ideal dataset to answer this question would include multiple measures of student success, both in and out of their control. This could potentially mean demographic information, information about their parents education/job, and their past academic performance. It would also include data about their alcohol consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we are trying to answer a predictive question, we would ideally like a larger dataset of 300+ observations so we can effectively split our data into testing and training data, and still have a big enough sample size in order to train a model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, the variables would be collected and arranged in a tidy way, with each observation representing a student and each column representing an attribute of the student. Additionally, it would be nice if each column had the correct type, and not, for example, having numeric variables stored as strings. Having typo free data and missing data all encoded the same way would be very helpful as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "After searching online for potential datasets, there do seem to be a few options that fit the majority of our criteria. This data is publically accessible as well, so we can use it for our analysis. Some of the available variables seem to be slightly different than what we originally envisioned, but they still seem to be workable."
