# Influence of Alcohol on Student Grades

## Project Overview
This repository explores the relationship between alcohol consumption and academic performance among students. By utilizing various statistical methods and machine learning algorithms, this project aims to uncover patterns, trends, and predictive insights into how alcohol intake influences student grades.

## Objectives
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize and understand initial patterns.
- Utilize regression analysis to assess the relationship strength between alcohol consumption and academic performance.
- Implement machine learning models to predict academic outcomes based on alcohol-related data.

## Methodology
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing relationships and distributions using graphs and statistical summaries.
- **Regression Analysis:** Evaluating correlations and deriving models to quantify the impact of alcohol consumption.
- **Machine Learning:** Applying predictive models to forecast academic outcomes.
