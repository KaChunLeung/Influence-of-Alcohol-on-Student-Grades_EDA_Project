    "Alcohol consumption is regarded as integral for a university's social culture and one's college experience. According to the National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, it has been reported that there are multiple factors that influence student drinking. Schools with strong Greek systems or prominent athletic programs tend to have students drink more than students at other schools, where alcohol consumption is highest among students living in fraternities or sororities.<a name=\"cite_ref-5\"></a>[<sup>5</sup>](#cite_note-5) College drinking can be harmful and impact multiple areas of a student's life. In our project, we study the effects of college drinking and alcohol consumption on one's academic performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "There have already been some studies done to analyze the impact of alcohol consumption on academic performance. The process of these studies have been to survey students on their alcoholic consumption and academic results, and then using different statistical methods to find an association between the two variables. However, when comparing the research with one another there have been mixed results, with the most common conclusions either being that there is a negative association between alcohol consumption and student academic performance or there not being a correlation between the two variables at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "One common conclusion is that alcohol consumption negatively affects academic performance. In a survey done by the CDC, the consensus is that students with higher grades are less likely to drink or engage in alcohol related behaviors than students with lower grades. It was reported that 12% of high school students with mostly A's had their first drink before the age of 13 (compared to 26% with mostly D's and F's), 27% reported current alcohol use (compared to 40%), and 13% reported current binge drinking (compared to 26%).<a name=\"cite_ref-4\"></a>[<sup>4</sup>](#cite_note-4) The survey proves association between alcohol consumption and academic performance, but not causation, which means that lower academic performance does not cause an increase in the likelihood that one engages in alcohol related behaviors, nor does alcohol consumption cause lower academic performance. This is valid because there can be other confounding variables that influence alcohol consumption and academic performance, such as family environment, household income, etc. Another study done by the University of Gloucester in the United Kingdom came to a similar conclusion as well. This study was measured based on multiple alcohol consumption indicators (length of time of and amount consumed during most recent drinking occasion, frequency of alcohol consumption, heavy episodic drinking, problem drinking) and multiple academic achievement indicators (importance of achieving good grades, actual academic performance, comparison of academic performance compared to peers).<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) They came to the conclusion that there are negative associations between alcohol consumption at any level and motivation for good grades and academic performance.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) \n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are other studies that found that there is no link between alcohol consumption and academic performance. One study done at the University of Hampshire measured the effect on college students' alcohol use on their GPA, in which a survey was done asking students about their average alcohol consumption per week and cumulative GPA. <a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3) It was found that most students who took the survey reported that they drank an average of 2-3 days a week, and had an average cumulative GPA of 3.0 - 3.5.<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3) The researchers came to the conclusion that there was no significant relationship between GPA and alcohol consumption. Another study done by researchers at Queen's University came to a similar conclusion, in which they measured based on the number of alcoholic drinks a student consumed each day per week, class absence, and academic performance. This study also included a confounding variable of house environment, in which they measure whether or not house environment affects alcoholic consumption. The results of the study were that there is not really a relationship between alcohol consumption and academic performance, but there was a correlation between house environment and alcohol consumption and absence rates.<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2) This means that students who lived in an environment where their roommates drank more often were more likely to drink and miss class regularly.<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2) The main limitations with each of these studies were the small sample size and a lack of understanding of students' drinking patterns. Further research, including a larger and more representative sample where research is done across multiple college campuses, will lead to a stronger conclusion. \n",

    "## Main Hypothesis: \n",
    "- Higher levels of alcohol consumption are negatively correlated with students' academic performance, leading to lower final grades.\n",
    "\n",
    "This hypothesis is based on the premise that excessive alcohol consumption can impair cognitive functions, diminish study time, and lead to increased absenteeism, all of which detrimentally affect a student's ability to perform academically. This relationship is expected to manifest across various indicators of academic success, including grades, GPA, attendance, and extracurricular participation, and is supported by research linking substance use with academic challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hypotheses for Subquestions:\n",
    "1. __Weekday Consumption Hypothesis__: Higher alcohol consumption during weekdays is more negatively correlated with academic outcomes than lower levels of consumption, due to its proximity to academic obligations and its potential to disrupt weekly academic routines and responsibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. __Weekend vs. Weekday Consumption Hypothesis__: Weekend alcohol consumption has a different impact on academic outcomes compared to weekday consumption, with the hypothesis being that while both negatively affect academic performance, weekday consumption has a more immediate and severe impact due to interference with regular study schedules and next-day academic obligations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. __Patterns of Consumption and Academic Achievement Hypothesis__: There are discernible patterns of alcohol consumption among students with varying levels of academic achievement, with the expectation that students with higher academic engagement and success (broadly measured through a composite of grades, GPA, attendance, and extracurricular activity) might exhibit different alcohol consumption behaviors compared to their lower-achieving counterparts. This hypothesis seeks to explore whether high achievers consume less alcohol due to prioritizing their academic and extracurricular commitments or if patterns of consumption do not significantly vary by achievement level."

    "The ideal dataset to answer this question would include all public schools in a country, and would have observations at the student level. This would allow us to predict individual student success, but also look at things in aggregate at a school level. \n",
    "\n",
    "Gathering such large swaths of data would be fairly difficult though, as alcohol consumption is not something typically recorded by school districts. Additionally, release all students grades, demographic information and other personal information could be seen as grossly unethical and a huge invasion of privacy. It is more likely that we will only find a smaller dataset that has students who explicitly consent to releasing their personal information,grades, and alcohol consumption patterns. Thus, as long as we could find a large enough sample size, perhaps 300+ students, this would be enough for us to train and test our model on.\n",
    "\n",
    "We would measure student success using grades/GPA as a metric. Their overall scores in their classes are what we would try to predict. \n",
    "\n",
    "To answer this question, we would need to have data on their background, both things in and out of control. This could potentially mean demographic information, information about their parents education/job, and their past academic performance. It would also include data about their alcohol consumption. The data should have alcohol consumption as a continous variable rather than simply a binary yes/no to drinking variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we are trying to answer a predictive question, we would ideally like a larger dataset of 300+ observations so we can effectively split our data into testing and training data, and still have a big enough sample size in order to train a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, the variables would be collected and arranged in a tidy way, with each observation representing a student and each column representing an attribute of the student. Additionally, it would be nice if each column had the correct type, and not, for example, having numeric variables stored as strings. Having typo free data and missing data all encoded the same way would be very helpful as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "After searching online for potential datasets, there do seem to be a few options that fit the majority of our criteria. This data is publically accessible as well, so we can use it for our analysis. Some of the available variables seem to be slightly different than what we originally envisioned, but they still seem to be workable."

Some important variables included are alcohol consumption, term 1 and 2 grades, parents education (which can be a proxy for SES), and some other indicators of past academic performace. Since we have access to both term one and term two grades, we could potentially calculate the change in alcohol consumption and the change in grades per student and do a paired t-test. \n",

    "The datasets seem to be kept in pretty tidy format, so minimal cleaning/wrangling will have to be done. We should search the data for NAs, and if there are a high amount, we can decide if we want to remove observations with any NAs or if they should meet a certain threshold. We will also need to ensure all data is in the correct format (numeric variables are stored as int/float, etc). Some data is encoded weirdly (fam size is a binary but the way it is stored is not intuitive), so it could be better recoded as a simple 0/1. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since we have two datasets, they will need to be merged. There are several students that overlap between both datasets, however some are unique to each. We would use their unique identifiers to match the students in both datasets and merge them. This poses a challenge to training the model, because we don't want to double count any students and let them get trained in the model twice. However, if we don't allow them to count for math and portugese, we will have to decide which class we choose to include their grades for. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most fair/robust solution would probably to randomly generate 0's and 1's for students who have both math and portugese grades. If they are assigned 0, we use their math grade. If they are assigned 1, we use their portugese grade. "

    "The data that we will be using for this project is allowed for public access and use, meaning no direct permission is needed. The dataset is from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/student-alcohol-consumption, which is an open-sourced dataset website. The data has been accumulated by UC Irvine's Machine Learning Repository.  As an accumulation of data regarding student and parent information, we are confident that the data we used hold no risk to the students and parents themselves because no names are included in the dataset. Although more of one school is represented in the dataset than the other, we believe that this difference should not make the dataset more biased towards one school than the other, nor should there be any issues with bias in the dataset used in this project.  However, the uploader of the data is a random person who used UCI Machine Learning's data, so the individual is capable of acting unethically, and such unintended consequences resulting from such acts should be considered."
